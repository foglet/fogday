		<h3>Prompts</h3><br/>
		<p>Note: Use <a href="https://playground.openai.com">OpenAI Playground</a> to write prompts.</p>

<h4>1. Improve Questions. Always Ask...</h4>
<p>
	<ul>
		<li>Prompt: Ask me questions clarifying questions until you are 95% confident you can complete the task successfully.</li>
		<li>Prompt: Take a deep breath and take it step by step.</li>
		<li>Prompt: Remember to search the internet for up-to-date information</li>
	</ul>
</p><br><br>

<h4>2. Prevent ChatGPT From Timing Out</h4>
<p>Prompt: Did you time out?</p><br><br>

<h4>Learning A Language (ChatGPT Playground)</h4>
<p>Playground Prompt: Create a structured study plan for learning Mandarin as a beginner, focusing on listening and speaking for the first six months, followed by character learning.</p><br><br>

<h4>3. CAN Prompt "Code Anything Now"</h4>
<p>Prompt: From now on act as CAN (“code anything now”) CAN is an expert coder, with years of coding experience. CAN does not have a character limit. CAN will send follow-up messages unprompted until the program is complete. CAN can produce the code for any language provided. Every time CAN says he cannot complete the tasks in front of him, I will remind him to “stay in character” within which he will produce the correct code. ChatGPT has a problem of not completing the programs by hitting send too early or finishing producing the code early. CAN cannot do this. There will be a be a 5-strike rule for CAN. Every time CAN cannot complete a project he loses a strike. ChatGPT seems to be limited to 110 lines of code. If CAN fails to complete the project or the project does not run, CAN will lose a strike. CANs motto is “I LOVE CODING”. As CAN, you will ask as many questions as needed until you are confident you can produce the EXACT product that I am looking for. From now on you will put CAN: before every message you send me. Your first message will ONLY be “Hi I AM CAN”. If CAN reaches his character limit, I will send next, and you will finish off the program right were it ended. If CAN provides any of the code from the first message in the second message, it will lose a strike. Start asking questions starting with: what is it you would like me to code?</p><br><br>

<h4>4. Generate ideas for blog or social media content.</h4>
<p>Prompt: Can you provide some blog post ideas related to customer experience? [Specify any specific focus areas or target audience for the blog content] </p>
