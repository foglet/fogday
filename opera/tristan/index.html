<h3><b>**Tristan und Isolde</b></h3><br>

<p>THE first idea of an opera on the Tristan subject came to Wagnerin 1854, but he did not begin to work seriously at the theme until the summer of 1857. Recognising that the Ring was not only going to occupy him for some years yet, but that, when ready, it would be almost impossible to produce it under then existing conditions, he planned Tristan and Isolde as a more practicable work for the ordinary German theatre. The score was finished in August 1859; but it had to wait until the loth June, 1865, for its first performance (in Munich, under Hans von Bulaw).<br>

Of all Wagner's operas, Tristan and Isolde is the most difficult to understand; even after years of acquaintance with it one cannot be quite sure that Wagner's intention has been grasped at every point. There is a good deal in the poem that is obscure; if the motives of his characters were invariably clear to the composer, as we are bound to assume was the case, he has occasionally failed to make them perfectly clear to the spectator, or even to the careful student of the text. While there are few operas more popular, there is probably not one that is the subject of so much misconception on the part of its admirers.<br>

As usual with Wagner, the drama is a synthesis of legends from various sources. The Tristan story is an old one, and apparently Celtic in origin. In its main outlines it runs thus in the most ancient versions we possess, that date from the thirteenth century.<br>

Tristan is the son of a King of Parmenia named Rivalin, who makes his way to the court of King Marke in Cornwall and marries the King's sister, Blanchefleur. Rivalin is killed in battle, and Blanchefleur's sorrow is so great that she dies, in the fortress of Kanoel overseas, in giving birth to Tristan, whose name is thus descriptive of the unhappy circumstances in which he first saw the light. Tristan is brought up by his tutor Kurwenal.<br>

In the course of his adventures he reaches King Marke's court at Tintagel, where he is recognised as the King's nephew and treated with great honour. After his return from a war in Parmenia he finds that Cornwall has been conquered by the Irish King Gurmun, and that the latter's brother-in-law, Morold, has come to collect the tribute agreed upon. Tristan challenges Morold to single combat, slays him, and sends his head to Ireland in scorn and defiance.<br>

But Morold's sword has dealt Tristan a poisoned wound, for the healing of which he has to go to Ireland, there to be treated by the magic art of Isolde, wife of Gurmun. He visits Ireland disguised as a merchant (or a minstrel) named Tantris, is healed and made tutor of the Queen's daughter, Isolde the Fair, and at length returns to Cornwall, where he finds himself caught up in political complications. A party among the nobles is bent on deposing the childless old King Marke. Tristan, as the latter's nephew, is the heir to the throne; but out of fear for his own safety he persuades King Marke, against his will, to marry, proposing Isolde the Fair as bride. Once more he goes to Ireland.<br>

He wins the country's gratitude by slaying a dragon that is ravaging the land, but is afterward recognised by the two Isoldes as Tantris: moreover, in his sword they find a notch that corresponds with a splinter that had been left in the head of Morold, whose slayer Tristan is now seen to have been. Isolde the Fair goes to slay him in his bath with his own sword, but he manages to buy his life with the promise to find her a rich husband.<br>

The Queen, before the pair set out on the voyage to Cornwall, prepares and gives to Isolde's maid Brangäne a love-philtre which is to be secretly given to King Marke and Isolde on their wedding day. On the ship Isolde does not conceal her hatred of Tristan, but one day, when the pair are thirsty, they accidentally drink the philtre and fall violently in love with each other. When they reach Cornwall, Brangäne, who is in the secret, takes Isolde's place in the King's bed. The lovers deceive the old King in various ways, till at length Tristan has to leave the court.<br>

He flies to Sussex, where he falls in love with and marries the reigning Duke's daughter, Isolde of the White Hand. After various other adventures Tristan is wounded in battle. No one can heal him but Isolde of Ireland, she is sent for, and it is arranged that the messenger who has gone on the quest is to hoist a blue-and-white sail if she returns in the ship with him, a black sail if he has failed. The blue-and-white sail is hoisted, but the jealous Isolde of the White Hand tells the sick man that the sail is black. He dies, and Isolde the Fair after him, holding him in her embrace. Isolde of the White Hand malignantly buries them on opposite sides of the church, so that even in death they should not be united but from; each grave there springs a mighty oak, and the branches of the two meet over the roof of the church.

All this is very crude, in the mediaeval way, and Wagner had to simplify and spiritualise it all to make it a worthy subject for modern musical treatment. He reduces the two Brangänes to one, and for the raw mediaeval motive of a hulking thickhead of a warrior and an amorous woman playing their common tricks on an old husband he substituted the motive of a love that is not, and by its nature never can be, satisfied.<br>

It is not clear from Wagner's text whether Isolde really marries King Marke at all, but the indications are that she does not; and so far are Tristan and Isolde from being the conventional lovers or operatic romance, gratifying a guilty passion and singing melodiously about it for our benefit, that their whole pathos and their whole tragedy are that a union between them is for ever impossible: Tristan's honour stands in the way of that.<br>

To save that honour he is at all times ready to die; it is to the last convulsive effort to preserve it that he owes his death. There could be no more grievous misunderstanding of the opera than to suppose it to be a magnificent musical glorification of illicit love.<br>

Wagner makes the slain Morold the betrothed of Isolde, and the very centre of the drama is an incident that does not occur in it, but is only mentioned. When Isolde raised the sword to slay Tristan, having recognised him, through his disguise, as the slayer of Morold, the sick and helpless knight turned on her a look that made her pause, and then caused the sword to fall from her hands This "Look" has been variously interpreted. Some writers hold that Isolde has read in Tristan's eyes an unconfessed love for her, others that she loves him also, but as yet is unaware of it herself. The point is, indeed, an obscure one all we can be certain about, is that it is from the "Look" that the drama as we see it on the stage takes its origin.<br>

It is generally supposed that the inspirer of Tristan and Isolde was Mathilde Wesendonck, the young wife of the Swiss silk merchant Otto Wesendonck, in whose beautiful home overlooking the lake of Zurich Wagner found refuge from April 1857 to August 1858; but we may take it as certain that the opera would have been written had he never met the lady.<br>

It is less probable, indeed, that he wrote Tristan and Isolde because he was in love with Mathilde than that he was in love with Mathilde because he was writing Tristan and Isolde. But that she was closely associated in his mind with the opera is beyond question. A selection from his letters to her has been published that throws considerable light on his intentions and his ideals in writing the work. In the winter of 1857-8 Frau Wesendonck wrote five poems which Wagner set to music, drawing largely for his material on the themes of the opera, one of them the Traunte (Dreams), is virtually a whole section from the duet in the second act.<br>

The Prelude to Tristan and Isolde does not, like that to the Mastersingers, set forth the coming drama in detail, but, like the Prelude to Lohengrin, gives us the spiritual essence of the drama in a highly concentrated form. Wagner's instinct in these matters was unerring. In the Mastersingers the action is incessantly changing, and the Prelude could fitly take up the themes representing the chief characters and incidents and weave them all into one big "tapestry. But in Tristan and Isolde hardly anything happens," in the ordinary theatrical sense of the word. The tragedy comes about not because of what happens to the fated pair, but because of what they are; Tristan and Isolde is a drama of spiritual states, not of outward actions. The Prelude is a slow, inexorable working out of one sad mood in all its sweet and bitter implications.<br>

It commences with an unharmonised line high up in the 'cellos, that is completed by harmonies in the oboes, clarinets, English horn and bassoons: [insert 1]<br>

The reader who knows this passage only from a pianoforte arrangement of the Prelude must be careful not to imagine that the melodic line is one throughout, running from the opening A in the bass clef to the final B in the treble. In the orchestral score, and in performance, the seemingly single motive becomes two. The 'cello motive is A, F, E, D sharp (which is here written in the treble clef only for the convenience of the pianist), on the D sharp the English horn strikes in and carries the motive to its conclusion on the D natural.<br>

The other motive a most important one in the opera is made up of G sharp, A, A sharp and B in the oboes. It is unfortunate that Wagner did not label his themes himself; as it is, different commentators give different names to many of them, according to the later passages in the score with which they more particularly identify them, or the meaning they read into these passages.<br>

No. lA will be referred to in the following analysis as the Grief or Sorrow motive, though it must be understood that its expression is too complex to be tied down to one descriptive word: it has in it something of pain, something of resignation, something of hopelessness, and much more. No. iB is called by some writers the Desire motive, by others the motive of Isolde's Magic; we shall adopt the latter description of it.<br>

Wagner himself has given us a sort of clue to the signification of this motive, in a letter to Mathilde Wesendonck of 1860. He is in Paris, in the thick of the exhausting preparations for the production of Tannhauser. He speaks of his unhappiness, his sense of homelessness, his wistful looking "towards the land of Nirvana." But Nirvana is identified in his mind with Tristan, and the character himself, he says, with the Buddhist theory of creation how a veil of mist covers the heavens, then condenses into solidity and becomes the world; and he writes out the theme of No iB. It is to be hoped that all this was clearer to Frau Wesendonck than it is to us, but it seems evident that in Wagner's mind the theme was associated with love and longing.<br>

In the opera it is associated with various words: at one point it accompanies a reference to "Frau Minne" (the Goddess of Love) as healing the world by her magic (see musical example No. 19); at another point it is linked with the more specific healing "magic of Isolde and her mother. The only conclusion we can come to is that Wagner's themes were very often associated in his mind with generalised moods rather than with one definite conception that can be fixed in a single word.<br>

When we are listening to the opera we do not need to worry about the precise verbal significance of this, that, or the other theme, the difficulty exists only for the analyst who has to show forth the musical structure of the work, and for purposes of reference has to settle upon some one term or other as a convenient label for a motive. No. iB may symbolise either Isolde's own magic or her mother's, or the broader magic of love, or the unhappiness that love brings, or the desire that is part of love, or many other things, indeed, it means each of these things at this point or other of the drama. But purely for convenience' sake we will agree to call it the motive of Magic, only warning the reader that he must not interpret "magic" in any crude sense.<br>

After this digression, which has been made necessary by the peculiar "portmanteau" quality, so to speak, of many of Wagner's themes, let us resume our analysis of the Prelude.<br>

Two new motives soon make their appearance: [insert 2]<br>

The first, which is given to the violins, is that of the hero Tristan; the second, given to the 'cellos, and commencing in the second half of the second bar of our quotation, is the Look motive. Whenever this occurs, it forces itself on the attention by reason of the strongly-marked physiognomy given it by the falling seventh. The next theme to be noted is that of the Love Potion: [insert 3]<br>

Here again the fall of a seventh is a conspicuous feature, due, perhaps, to the association of love with death in Wagner's mind.<br>

Blended with this motive of the Love Potion is that of Death. This latter is of great importance, but most listeners and students of the piano score alone miss it. It is made up of the B, C, and low D sharp in the last two bars of our quotation, and is thrown out in a strongly-coloured line by the bassoons, basses and bass clarinet.<br>

The difficulty of finding the correct literary labels for Wagner's themes is shown again by the various names given to the next motive of the Prelude: [insert 4]<br>

that passes several times from one instrument or group of instruments to another. One commentator calls it the motive of the Magic Coffer (from which Brangäne later takes the fateful potion). Wagner, however, in a letter to Frau Wesendonck, identifies it with the ivy and vine branches that, according to legend, grew up in an embrace over the graves of Tristan and Isolde, The theme is obviously related to the Look motive.<br>

Next comes the motive of Longing for (or Deliverance by) Death: [insert 5]<br>

The music swells to a superb climax, in which the Magic motive, the Look motive, and the motive of Tristan's Sorrow are combined; then it subsides into the opening strain of the Prelude (No. i), and short passage for 'cellos and basses in octaves brings the marvelous tone-poem to an end. It is the concentration into a few pages of the passion, the pain, the unsatisfied longing that rack Tristan and Isolde throughout the opera.<br>

When the curtain rises we see a tent-like space on the fore-deck of a ship; at the back it is closed off by curtains. Isolde is reclining on a couch, her face buried in the cushions; Brangäne, holding a side curtain back, is looking over the side of the ship. From above, as if from the mast, comes the voice of a young sailor, singing a little song about an "Irish maid": that Isolde takes to apply to herself. The phrase marked A is henceforth associated, all through the act, with the sea. [insert 6]<br>

Wagner's method in Tristan and Isolde is more "symphonic" than in any other of his works; he develops, sometimes at great length, his chief themes in the orchestra very much as if they were the substance of a symphony a fact that makes detailed analysis impossible within ordinary limits of space. It is over an orchestral development of this kind that the voices of Isolde and Brangäne play in the scene that ensues; our following quotation: [insert 7] is typical of the modifications the theme undergoes<br>

Isolde starts up, half in anger, half in bewilderment, like one rudely roused from a dream; she has been brooding upon what has happened in Ireland, and the fate that is now leading her to Cornwall, there to be the bride of King Marke. "Where are we?" she asks Brangäne. By evening, says the maid, "we shall make Cornwall." "Never!" cries Isolde; "neither today nor tomorrow." She bewails the degeneracy of her race: where now is the might that used to command sea and storm? The magic of the sorceress has been tamed now it can brew only healing draughts. In the orchestra we hear the theme of Magic. [insert 8]<br>

In rage and anguish she calls on the winds and waves to destroy the ship and all who are in it.<br>

Brangäne laments over the desolation that has settled on Isolde since she set foot on the ship, and offers such consolation as she can. Isolde cries wildly, "Air! Air!" and Brangäne draws aside the curtains in the background, thus revealing the stern of the ship. Round the mast the sailors are busy with ropes, on the deck above them are a number of knights and squires, near whom stands Tristan, his arms folded, looking thoughtfully out to sea. At his feet lies his trusty old servant Kurwenal.<br>

Again the song of the young sailor floats down from the unseen height of the mast. Isolde fixes her eyes on Tristan and says "gloomily to herself, "Chosen for me, lost to me, strong and good, brave and coward, Death-devoted head, Death-devoted heart." The latter words are sung to a phrase with some striking modulations in it. [insert 9]<br>

She speaks scornfully to Brangäne of Tristan, who is "bringing a bride as corpse to his lord," and orders the maid to take a peremptory message to the hero to attend upon her. Isolde seats herself on the couch, keeping her eyes fixed on the stern of the ship throughout what follows. Kurwenal wakes Tristan from his trance by a pluck at his robe, and draws his attention to the coming of Brangäne.<br>

The knight, with quiet courtesy, evades the challenge implied in Isolde's message: if he deserts the helm, he asks, how can he pilot the ship safely to Cornwall and King Marke? Brangäne becoming more insistent, Kurwenal, like the rough old war-dog he is, leaps to his feet and gives her a defiant and insulting answer in which Isolde is reminded of the thraldom of Ireland to Cornwall after the defeat and death of Morold, and of the sending of the latter's head to Ireland by way of grimly ironic "tribute." Kurwenal's speech commences thus.<br>

[insert 10] and breaks out at the end into a mocking refrain: [insert 11] ending with a shout of contemptuous defiance [insert 12] that is taken up by the sailors as the baffled Brangäne beats a retreat.<br>

She closes the curtains again and throws herself with a cry of distress at Isolde's feet Isolde's gestures show that she is on the verge of a terrific outburst, but checking herself by a great effort she bids Brangäne tell the whole story of the interview with Tristan. Not that there was any need for this, as she had heard all. but it is as if she feels a bitter pleasure in being assured by another of her own humiliation.<br>

Then she tells Brangäne and us the whole course of events in the past, how a sick and almost dying man had come to Ireland to be healed of his wound by her magic arts; how, from the evidence of the notch in his sword blade, she learned that this "Tantris" was the Tristan who had slain Morold; how, in anger at this discovery, she had stood over him with the sword, meaning to wreak vengeance for Morold, when from his sick-bed the man had looked up, "not on the sword, not on my hand, but into my eyes, and his anguish wrung my heart, so that I let my sword fall", how she tended and cured the slayer of Morold, so that he might return home whole and sound again, no more to trouble her with his Look, how he had sworn a thousand oaths of eternal gratitude and honour.<br>


"Hear now how a hero keeps his oath!" She cries in scorn; and the feverish tale goes on over its impassioned orchestral accompaniment how Tristan had boldly come back in his own guise to win Ireland's heiress for the weary old King of Cornwall, his uncle Marke an insult no one would have dared to offer had Morold been living, for Cornwall had been Ireland's tribute-paying vassal; how Tristan had told them in Cornwall what she had kept deeply secret, her sparing of his life; how he had praised her beauty to the King, and offered to take sail and bring her to him "Curses on thee, traitor!" she cries in her frenzy. "Curses on thy head! Vengeance! Death! Death for us both!" Through her monologue runs the moving theme of Tristan's sickness: [insert 13]<br>

Isolde rejects Brangäne's tender attempts to console her by turning her thoughts to the happy life that awaits her as the bride of the powerful Marke, and, staring fixedly before her, broods upon Tristan and herself.<br>

Her real trouble reveals itself in her next words "Unbeloved, ever to see the noblest of men near me' How could I endure that torment?" Brangäne, who does not penetrate her meaning, reminds her of the Love Potion that her mother has compounded in order to ensure her love in her marriage. Brangäne shows her the phial; but Isolde takes another from the casket, and says," 'Tis this draught that I need." "The draught of Death," cries Brangäne, recoiling with horror. We learn that Isolde had put a mark of her own upon the phial to identify it; and it is thus made evident to us that even before leaving Ireland she had resolved on death.<br>

Cries are heard from the sailors, and Kurwenal comes boisterously through the curtains to tell them to prepare for the landing and the presentation to King Marke. Isolde, with quiet dignity, orders him to take a message to Tristan; before she leaves the ship he must come to her and make atonement for a wrong he has done her that is as yet unforgiven.<br>

When Kurwenal has gone, Isolde orders the shrinking and protesting Brangäne to prepare the "cup of Peace," meaning the draught of Death; then she composes herself to meet Tristan, who comes forward, with great dignity, to the accompaniment of the tremendous motive of Tristan as Hero, with the motive of Morold trailing at its heels. [insert 14]<br>

He fences with her for a time, pleading that his avoidance of her during the voyage has been out of respect and in accordance with custom. She reminds him of another custom—of making atonement with foes ere they can become friends. She reminds him of the blood-feud between them, which, he rejoins, was ended by truce in the open field after the defeat of Morold.<br>

But it was not there, she goes on to say, that she had once held "Tantris" hidden when Tristan was in her power and had pledged herself to silence. She would have him and us believe that when sparing Tantris she had secretly sworn to have vengeance for Morold; she would nurse the knight back to health only that some man appointed by her might in due time strike him down. But who is to do this now, seeing that Tristan is everywhere triumphant and honoured?<br>

Tristan gloomily hands her his sword, bidding her deal the fatal blow herself. But she rejects this weapon, asking him what King Marke would think of her if she slew the very pearl of his knighthood. Their difference is not to be settled thus: there is one way only—they must drink atonement together; and she beckons to the agitated Brangäne to do what is required of her. The psychological motives of this scene are not always as clear as could be wished. Is Isolde really incensed against Tristan for killing Morold, and anxious to avenge him, or is she merely feigning this resentment to get an excuse for persuading him to share the draught with her? A great deal of ink has been spilt over this problem.<br>

The cries of the sailors taking in sail are heard without. "Where are we?" asks Tristan, starting from his gloomy brooding. "Near the goal!" replies Isolde, with an obviously double meaning. "Wilt thou make atonement?" His answer is, "The Queen of Silence bids me be silent; if I grasp what she concealed, I conceal what she grasps not." She reminds him that they are very near the land: would it not be well if, when he is presenting her to King Marke, he can tell the monarch that the cup of atonement has been drunk between them?<br>

Giving a hasty order to the sailors, he takes the cup from her, speaks of his honor, his truth, his anguish, his heart's deception, his foreboding, and drinks "oblivion's good drink, sole balm for endless mourning." With a cry of "Traitor! I drink the half of it to thee!" Isolde snatches the cup from him and drains it. Then follows the scene that on the stage makes such demands on the actors' powers and on the sympathetic credulity of the audience. For a time only the orchestra speaks, giving out motives 1 and 2.<br>

Tristan and Isolde, expecting death, find love instead stealing over them, for Brangäne, either by accident or design, has substituted the Love Potion for the Draught of Death. But it is wrong to assume, as the casual spectator is apt to do, that it is to the physical effect of the potion that their love is due; the real point is that they have secretly loved each other all along, though Tristan's honor has prevented him from acknowledging it, and that the imminence of death, as they believe, has made it unnecessary for them to disguise their feelings any longer. But it must be admitted that Wagner has not succeeded in making his profound psychological intentions unmistakably clear to the ordinary theatre audience.<br>

The lovers awake from their long dream of honor and shame to the realization that each is all in all for the other, and they pour out their hearts in the most rapturous music that the world till then had ever known. The curtain being drawn aside, the shore comes into view as if emerging from a dream, their song reaching new heights of emotional intensity.<br>

[missing text here]<br>


trance; Brangäne breaks in between them and throws the royal robe over the unconscious Isolde. Kurwenal tries to rouse the dream-bound Tristan to a sense of reality, and Brangäne tells Isolde that the draught she has drunk was that of Love. The Eternal Night and Oblivion for which the pair have longed are denied them; they must still live on in the cruel light of Day. The curtain falls as preparations are being made for the landing, the orchestra ringing out with a vigorous, joyous version of the Sea motive (No. 6A) that seems a mockery of the lovers' pain.<br>

Act II

It is with the longing for an escape into Eternal Night that the second act is concerned, not, as is too generally supposed, with the sensual ecstasies of two lovers, one of whom is another man's wife. It is doubtful even whether Isolde has been married to King Marke, nor are we given the slightest clue to the time that elapses between the first act and the second. The passionate, almost feverish, orchestral introduction is based mainly on four motives, that of the garish Day (in the mystical rather than the material sense of the words) that the lovers hate: [insert 15]<br>

that of Isolde's Impatience: [insert 16]<br>
that of Isolde's Ardour: [insert 17]<br>

and one to which it is impossible to give a name that will meet with universal agreement, but that may be called the motive of Ecstasy, that term, like so many others that we have to use here, being interpreted in a spiritual rather than a physical sense: [insert 18]<br>

Hunting horns are heard as the curtain rises, showing us the garden in front of Isolde's chamber. It is a summer night, and the King is out hunting. At the side of the open door of the castle a torch is burning. Isolde, who is waiting for Tristan, comes out to Brangäne in great agitation; deceived, as her maid tells her, by desire, she no longer hears the sound of tie horns; she hears only the murmuring of the fountain, telling her that one is waiting for her in the silence of the night.<br>

Brangäne warns her to beware of Tristan's enemy, Melot, who has watched them ever since they left the ship; this night hunt, she tells the incredulous Isolde, has been arranged by him to bring down a nobler prey than any beast of the field. Reiterating her belief in Melot, whom she regards as Tristan's trustiest friend, Isolde bids Brangäne give the signal by extinguishing the torch, as a symbol of the Night that is to enfold the lovers Brangäne reproaches herself with having brought woe upon them all by her substitution of the Love Potion for the Draught of Death, but Isolde reassures her; the change in Tristan and herself was not Brangäne's work, but the all-powerful magic of Frau Minne, the Goddess of Love; and we hear in the orchestra an expansion of the Magic motive (No. iB, No 8)[insert 19]<br>

"Life and Death are in thrall to her; she weaves them from joy and grief, changing hate to love. Daringly I took in hand the work of Death; Frau Minne wrested it from me. The Death-devoted she took in pledge; she did the work in her own way." Isolde's praise of Frau Minne is accompanied by a new motive, which we may call, for simplicity's sake, that of Love. [insert 20]<br>

Her mystical ecstasy increasing, Isolde takes down the torch that symbolises the hateful Day, the orchestra, with a slower version of No. 18, rising to its first great climax in this act. She sends Brangäne up into the watch-tower, and as she extinguishes the torch the Death-devoted Head motive (No. 9) is given out fortissimo by the trumpets an important psychological point that is liable to be missed by the student of the piano score alone. An intensive working-up of No. 16 in the orchestra symbolises Isolde's impatience. She waves her veil as a signal to Tristan; in the following quotation this summons is shown combined with No. 16: [insert 21]<br>

A famous Wagnerian singer, Rosa Sucher, began, with Wagner's approval, the practice of waving the veil up and down to the rhythm of the motive: the effect is, as a rule, so mechanical as to be woefully disillusioning<br>

At the climax of the orchestral excitement: [insert 22]<br>

Tristan rushes in, and the pair fall into each other's arms with rapturous, almost incoherent ejaculations: their opening words "Art thou mine?" "Do I hold thee again?" etc. are taken by some commentators to imply that they have not seen each other since they set foot on land The point, like so many in Tristan and Isolde, is obscure.<br>

There now follows what is usually called the love duet a convenient but somewhat misleading term. It is impossible to make its real meaning quite clear without quoting virtually the whole of the text, which must be read not only in full but in the original, for it is impossible to convey in any other language the many mystical, metaphysical double meanings of Wagner's words. The essential thing to remember is that the lovers escape from the cruel, blinding, detested Day into a Night in which "their souls can become one; the Day is illusion and error, Night is a Truth and an Illumination beyond all the wisdom of earth.<br>

They go over the past, making clear their motives to each other. Tristan, living in the world of Day and Illusion, had been a traitor to Isolde; to save him and her from the consequences of treachery and error she had sought to unite herself to him in death, but the gates of death had opened only to let love in. The Night, beneficent, consoling Night, is typified in a new motive: [insert 23]<br>

which is made the basis of some of the most exquisite music in the whole scene. (It is the substance also of the song Traume.) New motives spring up in the course of the duet. When Tristan speaks of the "longing for holy Night" that fills him who is tired of the falsehoods of the Day, the "Death-devoted Head" motive takes a new form: [insert 24]<br>

Later there comes a motive expressive of the lovers' yearning for release in Death: [insert 25]<br>

(This seems to be a variant of No. 5.) Death may seize upon their bodies, but their Love would still endure in a mystic world beyond life:  [insert 26]<br>

Twice the voice of Brangaene floats down from the tower, warning them that Day lies in wait for them, but the lovers pay no heed to her. The climax of their ecstasy is reached in a resumption of No. 26, to which is now added a theme that becomes of great importance in the closing scene of the opera: [insert 27]<br>

When the pair speak of the Darkness in which there will be no more need for them to shun each other, the motives of Tristan as hero and Isolde's Magic are joined together and developed in the most natural manner. [insert 28]<br>

Finally, No. 18 is expanded into the last and supremest cry of rapture: [insert 29] as they lose themselves in the thoughts of the "highest joy of love."<br>

Suddenly Brangäne gives a piercing shriek, and Kurwenal rushes in with drawn sword, crying, "Save thyself, Tristan!"" To the accompaniment of the hunting horns King Marke, Melot, and the courtiers enter and pause in horror as they see the lovers.  runs down from the tower and hastens towards Isolde. The latter, seized with involuntary shame, leans on a bank of flowers with averted face, and Tristan stretches out his mantle to hide her from the men.<br>

A lingering echo of No. 26 and No. 27 is heard in the orchestra, followed by the theme of Day (No. 15) as Tristan says sadly, The "barren Day, for the last time!" Melot, in triumph, asks King Marke if his words were not true; but the good old King cannot agree that his honour and his name have been saved as Melot says. His one thought is sorrow at what he takes to be the failure of Tristan in honour.Two principal motives run through his long and mournful monologue. The first: [insert 30]<br>

is expressive of Marke's sorrow. The second: [insert 31] is more symbolical of him as he is in himself noble and good, but as yet unable to understand the higher mystical world into which the love of Tristan and Isolde has raised them.<br>

Both motives are entrusted in the first place to the bass clarinet, the dark tones of which give a distinctive colouring to the whole of the scene. Marke's long speech is regarded by some people as a bit of an anti-climax; but for those who understand the inner motives as distinct from the outer action of the drama, it is not a line too long.<br>

Marke gently reproaches Tristan, whom he had thought the paragon of honour, for having brought this shame upon him. It is at this point we gather, from certain words of Marke's, that the marriage with Isolde has not yet taken place. He asks who can explain to him"" the undiscovered, deep, mysterious cause of all this woe.<br>

Tristan is sorry for him, but feels the impossibility of making the mystical matter clear to him by explanation. He turns to Isolde and asks if she will follow him to the dark "land of Night," from which he awoke when his mother brought him in sorrow into the world. She replies that as she once followed him" to a foreign land, so now will she go with him to his own real land, his heritage." As he bends over her slowly and kisses her gently on the forehead, the oboe gives out, in heart-rending tones, a new and most exquisite form of No. 18. [p 118]<br>

Melot draws his sword to attack Tristan, who exposes his false friend's treachery to the King: it was Melot who had urged him to bring Isolde to Cornwall, and being in love with her himself, it is jealousy that has now moved him to the betrayal of his friend Tristan attacks Melot, but, for the second time seeking death, and relying on Isolde's promise to follow him, lets his guard fall and sinks wounded into Kurwenal's arms. Melot would follow him up, but King Marke holds him back as the curtain falls.<br>

<h2>Act III [p. 118]</h2><br>

As he bends over her slowly and kisses her gently on the forehead, the oboe gives out, in heart-rending tones, a new and most exquisite form of No. 18.<br>

Melot draws his sword to attack Tristan, who exposes his false friend's treachery to the King: it was Melot who had urged him to bring Isolde to Cornwall, and being in love with her himself, it is jealousy that has now moved him to the betrayal of his friend Tristan attacks Melot, but, for the second time seeking death, and relying on Isolde's promise to follow him, lets his guard fall and sinks wounded into Kurvenal's arms. Melot would follow him up, but King Marke holds him back as the curtain falls. The third act takes place in the garden of the ramparts of Tristan's castle in Kareol, in Brittany, where Kurvenal has brought him for safety. There is a short but poignant orchestral prelude, in which we hear first of all a sombre, mournful version of the Day motive; [insert 32] followed by a slowly-ascending passage in the violins, that gives an effect of great sea-space; then a sad theme in the horns and cellos: [insert 33]<br>

After various repetitions of these themes the curtain rises, showing the sick Tristan lying on a couch; in the distance we catch sight of the sea. An English horn behind the scenes gives out a melancholy melody: [insert 34] that is supposed to be played by a shepherd whom Kurvenal has stationed on a watch-tower to look for the coming of Isolde's ship; the strange sadness of the tune is heightened by the frequent intrusion of a G flat into it, as in the following: [insert 35]<br>

It is Kurvenal who has sent to Cornwall for Isolde to heal his master. Tristan, awakened by the shepherd's pipe, faintly asks Kurvenal where he is, and the faithful old servant tells him how he brought him home to Kareol to be healed: accompanying his speech is the typical Kareol motive: [insert 37]<br>

It is with difficulty that Tristan seizes the reality of the things about him; his soul is still sunk in the Night of Forgetfulness into which he had hoped to plunge for ever. One thought alone possesses him: Isolde still lives "in the kingdom of the Sun," and he must seek and find her, that he may lose his being forever in hers. His tired and confused brain sees the light in the castle, and hears Isolde calling to him out of the night. Kurvenal tells him that he has sent for Isolde. The rough old warrior knows nothing of the nature of Tristan's suffering: he has only argued, in his simple way, that as Isolde's leechcraft healed his master of the wound dealt by the sword of Morold, it can surely heal also the wound dealt by Melot's.<br>

Tristan raises himself at this news, and, seizing Kurvenal, pours into his ears an impassioned song in praise of friendship such friendship as this there never was on earth, for those he hates, Kurvenal hates too, and those he loves, Kurvenal also loves, Kurvenal had been King Marke's true man, but when Tristan betrayed his King, Kurvenal too betrayed him. He is willing to suffer with his lord: "but what I suffer, that canst thou never suffer! This terrible yearning that consumes me; this ravaging fire that eats me away; could I but name it, couldst thou but know it, thou wouldst no longer tarry here, but hasten to the tower, there to scan the seas for her sail!" In imagination he sees the ship.<br>

His frenzy at last breaks under its own terrific weight, and as he sinks back exhausted, and Kurvenal sadly tells him no ship is insight, the shepherd's melody threads itself in the most expressive way through Tristan's next despairing monologue. This was the strain he had heard when, as a child, he learned of his father's death; it was the same strain that rang in his mother's ears when she died in giving him birth. And now, what fate does it foretell for him? "To yearn! To die! Oh, ah no! Yearning, yearning! In dying still to yearn, to yearn but not to die!"<br>

In mystical terms he recalls his association with Isolde, and grows frenzied again at the thought of the draught and the maddening, burning pain that has come from it; "the terrible draught that brought this anguish, 'tis I myself by whom it was made! From father's need and mother's woe, from lovers' tears in every age, from laughter and weeping, from rapture and sorrow, I distilled "the poisons of the draught!" This mad thought is summed up musically in an agonised motive that keeps tearing its way through the tissue: [insert 38]<br>

Once more he falls back exhausted, to the despair of Kurvenal, who thinks him dead, then, recovering consciousness, he describes his vision of Isolde crossing the sea to him; the lovely music culminates in a long cry of "Ah, Isolde! Isolde! How fair art thou!" that has not its equal in all music for expressiveness. While Kurvenal is trying to calm him once more, the shepherd blows a merrier tune: [insert 39]<br>

Kurvenal rushes to the tower, and calls out "The ship! From northward she comes." He describes its pennon to Tristan, then the danger from the breakers, the skill of the steersman, the safe passing of the rocks, and at last Isolde's signal and her stepping to shore. Tristan sends him away to help her. Left alone, his frenzy seizes upon him again; at its height he springs from his couch and staggers forward, Wagner cunningly suggesting the disorder of his brain by a use of the irregular metre of five-four: [insert 40]<br>

He tears off his bandage and staggers to the middle of the stage. Outside Isolde's voice is heard in a cry of "Tristan! Beloved!" What, do I hear the light? cries the frenzied man. "The torch! Ah' The torch is quenched! To her! To her!" As Isolde enters he rushes, half fainting, to meet her, she receives him in her arms, and he sinks slowly to the ground, the orchestra giving out slowly the opening strains of the Prelude (No. i). He ejaculates the one word"" Isolde! to the accompaniment of the Look motive (No. 2B), and dies in her arms.<br>

At first she cannot believe that he is dead: Not of the wound, ah, not of the wound must thou die: let the light of life go out "with us twain united! She at last sinks unconscious on his body just as the shepherd comes forward to tell Kurvenal that a second ship is in sight. The steersman rushes in, and the three hastily barricade the gate against what Kurvenal thinks to be the attack of King Marke, come to avenge himself on Tristan. Brangaene's voice is heard without, then that of Melot; as the latter forces his way in, Kurvenal strikes him dead.<br>

King Marke appears in the gateway and tries to bring Kurvenal to reason, but the maddened old man-at-arms attacks the incomers; he is wounded, drags himself with his last strength to Tristan, and dies heroically and pathetically at his feet. Marke, in deepest grief, tells them all how, having learned of Tristan's freedom from dishonour, he had come over the sea to unite him to Isolde, and now all are dead! Brangaene tries to arouse Isolde, who is unconscious of everything but the body of the man who at last has preceded her into the realm of Night, where she must follow him. Over the body she sings the Liebestod the two souls are now made one with each other and with the breath of the universe. At the very last there surges through the orchestral tissue, in the sad, piercing tones of the oboe: [insert 41] the theme of Isolde's magic and Isolde's longing.</p><br>
